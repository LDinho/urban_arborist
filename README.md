####For the ethical gardener

####Summary
--------
HARNESSING THE POWER of the NYC open data through JSON and ruby, we built an app to help people find the right tree for them AND stay on the right side of the law! This app can help you find all the legal species of trees in NYC. Built in less than 3 hours, this sick app performs really advanced SoQL queries to match you the tree you need. Fall is upon us, so now you have the power at your fingertips to identify all the trees near you!

Landscapers, boy do we have the app you need. You can plan by color! height! shape! and SO MUCH MORE. Syncronizing your arboretum has NEVER been this easy. youre welcome 

####Technologies
We included 'open-uri', 'JSON', ruby and of course ASCII art!
